# tutor-database
A small program that allows private tutors to store data about their clients to a local database.
Made in Python 3.6 during the hackUCI Hackathon, this program gives tutors the ability to add and manage information about their clients (called "Tutorees" in the program) by inputing contact information, adding in records, and printing out tables.
